This is an Xfce panel plugin which allows you to control your V4l radio device.
It allows you to turn your radio on/off, tune it to some frequency and manage
station presets.


MOUSE CONTROLS
--------------
To switch your radio on/off, simple left-click on the panel (by default it says
"- off -", if it's turned on it displays the current frequency).

Once turned on, the middle button will show you the station preset menu. This
is also the place to set the frequency you'd like to tune your radio to.

The mouse wheel allows you to change frequency or station preset. You can
choose your preferred behaviour in the properties dialog (right-click menu).


KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Your station presets are currently only saved to disk if you change something
in the properties dialog afterwards. This probably won't be fixed with Xfce 4.2
as there simply doesn't seem to be a way for the plugin to get its settings
saved and Xfce only saves them after changes have been made in the properties
dialog. It will be fixed in the Xfce 4.4 release, though.
