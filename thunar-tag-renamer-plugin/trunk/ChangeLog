    anymore.

    memory leaks and adds whitespace removal for tags.

  * thunar-tag-renamer-plugin/thunar-sbr-tag-renamer.{c,h}: Added
    another naming scheme. Added "artist" and "title" properties to
    the renamer class. Use a GtkTable for the layout. Added an entry
    for entering a default artist (which replaces missing artist tags).
    Replace "/" with "_", bug reported by Jens.
