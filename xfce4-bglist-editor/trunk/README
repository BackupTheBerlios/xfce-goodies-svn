This is a background list editor for xfdesktop. Note that xfdesktop itself
needs to be patched to support that (i.e. to add it to the xfce settings).

But you can call xfce4-bglist-editor manually too to get an idea of how it
will look like. It takes one parameter, the name of the image list file:

xfce4-bglist-editor ~/.config/xfce4/desktop/image.list

Have fun!
