Minicmd XFce4 panel plugin (C) 2003 Biju Philip Chacko <botsie@users.sf.net>

Displays a mini-command line on the xfce4-panel. Uses the same history file as
xfrun4. Use <Up> and <Down> to scroll through history. <Enter> executes the
command and <Ctrl>-<Enter> executes the command in a terminal. <Tab>
auto-completes commands against history. Successive <Tab>s display successive
matches.
