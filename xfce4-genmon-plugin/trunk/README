Generic Monitor XFce4 panel plugin (GenMon)
===========================================


1 -	Description
	-----------
The GenMon plugin cyclically spawns the indicated script/program, captures its output and displays it as a string into the panel.


2 -	Installation
	------------
Do the usual stuff:
	- gunzip
	- tar xf
	- configure --prefix=<XFce4InstallationDir>	(e.g. /usr/local)
	- make
	- make install  (as root)
	
You should then end up with:
        libgenmon.a   libgenmon.la  libgenmon.so
installed in <XFce4InstallationDir>/lib/xfce4/panel-plugins/


3 -	Testing

Use GenMon for invoking the provided "datetime" shell script.
Then the current date/time should be continuously updated in your panel.


4 -	Extra

A simple Perl script, disktemp, that retrieves the temperature of a disk
using the smartmontools is provided.
To install it, as root you may do:
	- cp disktemp /usr/local/bin
	- cd /usr/local/bin
	- chown root:root	disktemp
	- chmod a+rx		disktemp
	- chmod u+s 		disktemp
Then run (you need to have smartd/smarctl installed on your system)
	- disktemp <disk>	(e.g. /dev/hda)
If this works, you should be able to use GenMon for continually monitoring
your disk temperature.


5 -	Bugs
	----
If you find a bug, fix it, then tell me how you did it :-)


Enjoy!
