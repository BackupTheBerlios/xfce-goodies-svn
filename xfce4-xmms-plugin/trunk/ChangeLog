	* unofficial 0.0.9 release
	* cleaned up all the info files
	* code finally works, compiles with only one error, loads perfectly
	* callbacks work so it unloads properly
	* pixmaps load now
	* cleaned the xmms_plugin.c file, got rid of all the scrap code
	* it works, despite the fact that its GIGANTIC.

	* put in pixmaps directory.  now builds .png files from
	.xcf files using ImageMagick's `convert'.  png's aren't
	removed on distclean, so its not required for clients to
	have this.

2003-11-08 04:42EST  pat

	* changes to Makefile.am in panel-plugin/ to compile && link
	xmms properly

2003-11-07 19:11EST  pat

	* slapped in code to make xmms-plugin, ripped out all sample
	code and made a mess of things.
	* so much crap its not even funny
	* buggy like week old milk thats been sitting on the counter
