can help fixing the problem by sending the following information:

- Battery information: "lshal | grep battery"
- Information from the HAL monitor:
  - Run "lshal -m" in a terminal
  - Discharge the battery from a couple of minutes
  - Plugin / out the adapter
  - Press Ctrl + C to end the monitoring

Copy the information obtained from the steps above, put it in a document
and send it to nick@xfce.org or create a bug report
