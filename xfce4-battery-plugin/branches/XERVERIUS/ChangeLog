  * Added USE_NEW_DIALOG if your libxfcegui4 version
    is high enough.
  * battery variable is not "external" anymore, but the
    size of the plugin seems to grow from 870Kb to 1.1Mb
    (with debug enabled), so I'm not very happy about it.
  * Enabled Info dialog again.

  * Coding style improvements
