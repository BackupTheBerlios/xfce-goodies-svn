XFce4 XKB Layout Switch panel plugin.

Information
===========

The plugin itself cannot be used for defining the keyboard
layouts one wants to use, this is done the XKB way - either 
in XF86Config or by xetskbmap tool.
The plugin may be used as an indicator for the current layout
and as a switcher to the next layout also.


XKB Configuration
=================

Here is an example XKB configuration (part from XF86Config):

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "Keyboard0"
	Driver      "keyboard"

  Option          "CoreKeyboard"
  Option          "XkbRules"      "xfree86"
  
  # This is the kb model.
  Option          "XkbModel"      "pc104"
  
  # These are the layouts you wish to use.
  Option          "XkbLayout"     "us,bg,es"
  
  # These are the various keyboard variants.
  Option          "XkbVariant"    ",phonetic,"

  # This option defines the kb shortcut which will switch
  # the layout.
  Option          "XKbOptions"    "grp:alt_shift_toggle"
EndSection
