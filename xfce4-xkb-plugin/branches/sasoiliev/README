XFce4 XKB Layout Switch panel plugin.

The plugin itself cannot be used for defining the keyboard
layouts one wants to use, this is done the XKB way - either 
in XF86Config or by xetskbmap tool.
The plugin may be used as an indicator for the current layout
and as a switcher to the next layout also.

NOTE: most of the XKB specific code is from the wmxkb program
by Michael Glickman <wmalms@yahooo.com>.
